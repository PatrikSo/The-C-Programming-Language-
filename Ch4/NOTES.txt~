Chapter 4 - Functions and Program Structure

4.1 Basics of Functions
    - patternString.c
    - source.c is a source file
    - source.o is a object file
    - a.out is a executable file
    - undefined functions are of type int by default
    
4.2 Functions returning non-integers
    - atof.c
    - functions should always have a visible definition!

4.3 External Variables
    - avoid static!! (cse3100 warnings)
    - external linkage: all references to externals all refer to the same thing (same external)
    - functions are external by default
    - can decalre external variables to be used throughout program
    - reverse polish notation is used by some pocket calculators, example in text!
