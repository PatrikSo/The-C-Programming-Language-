Chapter 5 - Pointer snd Arrays.

	- pointer is a variable that holds the address to another variable

5.1 Pointer and addresses
    - pointer is a group of cells that can hold an address
    - & operator gives the address of an object
    - * is the indirection/derefencing operator, applied to a pointer it gives the value/object the pointer points to
    - can incremement/decrement pointers (pointer arithmetic)
    - ++*ip increments whatever ip points to
    - (*ip)++ also increments (need paranth)
    - pointer can equal each other
      ip = iq makes ip point to whatever iq is pointing at

5.2 Pointers and Function Arguments
    - C is a call by value language, functions canot change their parameters
    - need pointers to the parameters to enable functions to alter given input
    - int a[10]; declared an array of 10 ints
    - int *pa = &a[0] point to the object stored in a[0]
    - x = *pa; puts whatever is in a[0] into x.
    - indexing and pointer arithmetic are very similar
    - array addresses are always at their 0th element
    - a[i] can also be written as *(a+i)
    - &a[i] and a+i are equivalent
    - array-and-index expression is equivalent to a pointer-offset expression
    - pointers are variables, arrays arent, pointers can use ++ operators
    - char *s; and char s[]; are equivalent

5.4 address arithmetic
    - can incremement pointers to new objects
    - pointers, arrays, address arithmetic are one of C's strengths
    - pointers and integers arent interchangeable
    - NULL is defined in stdio.h, used to indicate a special value for a pointer
    - can use comparison operators on pointers if they point to the same array
    - if p<q, q-p+1 is the number of elements from p to q inclusive
