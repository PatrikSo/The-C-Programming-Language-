Chapter 8 - UNIX System Interface

	- UNIX has system calls, used by programs.

8.1 File Descriptors
    - all input/output is done by reading/writing files (for UNIX)
    - when input/output is done on a file, file descriptor is used instead of the name to identify a file

8.2 Low Level I/O - Read & Write
    - used for functions such as fget() and fput()

8.3 Open, Creat, Close, Unlink
    - need to explicitly open files to read/write them
    - need two system calls, open & creat[sic]
    - open is like fopen but instead of returning file-pointer we get a file descriptor
    - file descriptors are int's
    - creat makes a file if it doesnt already exist
